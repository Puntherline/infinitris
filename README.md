Just a tetris clone I started making out of boredom and without much planning.

It's not finished (when clearing lines, it gets a bit wonky placing new pieces down) but I want to do something else for now so I'm just uploading it the way it is right now.

Do feel free to modify the code and do whatever you want with it. You can also just make some optimizations to the code and open a pull request, I'll read it and probably learn from my mistakes.
